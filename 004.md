# some functions will not work for some tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount

## Summary
Based on the Sense Finance document, any ERC20 token can get used in this protocol.

> DEPLOYMENT: mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism
**> ERC20: any (USDC, DAI, USDT, ETH, stETH, etc)**
> ERC721: none
> ERC777: none
> FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
> REBASING TOKENS: any
> ADMIN: trusted
> EXTERNAL-ADMINS: restricted

some functions will not work for some tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are tokens that don't support approve spender type(uint256).max amount. So some functions will not work for some tokens like UNI or COMP who will revert when approve type(uint256).max amount.

## Impact
Tokens that don't support approve type(uint256).max amount could not be swapped by calling Periphery.sol#L902._fillQuote function.

## Recommendation
I would suggest approve only the necessary amount of token to the approveTarget instead of the type(uint256).max amount.
