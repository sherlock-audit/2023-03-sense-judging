# setIsTrusted function allows anyone to update the isTrusted mapping for any user, including trusted ones.

## Summary
The `setIsTrusted` function in the Trust contract can be called by anyone who has the smart contract's address, not just the trusted users. This allows an attacker to update the `isTrusted` mapping for any user, compromising the smart contract's security.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Trust contract defines a mapping `isTrusted` which is used to store whether an address is trusted or not, the constructor of the contract sets the initial user as a trusted user.

The `setIsTrusted` function allows anyone to update the `isTrusted` mapping for any user, including trusted ones. This can be exploited by an attacker to change the trust status of any user, which could compromise the security of the smart contract.

To demonstrate the vulnerability, the `setIsTrusted` function from a non-trusted address and verifies that the trust status has been updated. Here is an example of such:
```python

         | TestTrust   |               |   Trust     |
         |             |               |             |
         +-------------+               +-------------+

                                    |

                      +-------------+----------------+
                      |                                |
                      |   function testUntrustedCanUpdateTrust |
                      |                                |

                      |   |
                      |   |   +-------------------------+
                      |   |   |                         |
                      |   +-->| setIsTrusted            |
                          |   |                         |
                          |   +-------------------------+

                              |                         |
                              +-------------------------+

```
The scenario shows two smart contracts, `TestTrust` and Trust, with `TestTrust` being the main contract and Trust being a dependency contract, the `TestTrust` contract has a constructor that takes an initial user address as input and creates a new instance of the Trust contract, passing the initial user address as an argument. The `TestTrust` contract also has a function called `testUntrustedCanUpdateTrust`, which is a public function that can be called by any user. This function first sets the calling user as `untrusted` by calling the `setIsTrusted` function of the Trust contract with the boolean value false as the second argument, It then verifies that the user is indeed `untrusted` by calling the `isTrusted` function of the Trust contract with the calling user's address as the argument, If the user is still trusted, the function will throw an error.

## Steps to Reproduce, Expected Result and the Actual Result:
```python
  +------------------------+        +------------------------+
  |  Deploy Trust Contract  |        |   Call setIsTrusted     |
  +------------------------+        +------------------------+
               |                                  |
               |                                  |
               |                                  |
               V                                  V
     +----------------------+      +-----------------------+
     |  Trust contract       |      |   Update isTrusted     |
     |                      |      |      mapping           |
     |  - setIsTrusted()    |      |  - only trusted users  |
     |  - isTrusted mapping |      |     can update         |
     +----------------------+      +-----------------------+
               |                                  |
               |                                  |
               |                                  |
               V                                  V
    +----------------------------+   +----------------------------+
    | Expected:                   |   | Actual:                    |
    | setIsTrusted called by      |   | setIsTrusted called by     |
    | trusted users only          |   | anyone with the contract's |
    | who can update the          |   | address, including        |
    | isTrusted mapping.          |   | attackers, compromising    |
    |                             |   | the contract's security.   |
    +----------------------------+   +----------------------------+

```
The diagram shows two boxes, representing the deployment of the Trust Contract and the calling of the `setIsTrusted` function, the rectangle representing the Trust Contract also appears, with its two components: the `setIsTrusted()` function and the `isTrusted` mapping.

Below these elements, there are two rectangles representing the expected and actual results.

The expected result states that only trusted users with permission can update the `isTrusted` mapping, while the actual result indicates that anyone with the contract's address can do so, compromising the contract's security.

## Impact
An adversary can update the `isTrusted` mapping for any user, including the trusted users, which could compromise the smart contract's security, and this can lead to unauthorized access to the smart contract and manipulation of the contract's state in the loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `setIsTrusted` function should be modified to only allow trusted addresses to update the `isTrusted` mapping.
This can be achieved by adding a check in the modifier `requiresTrust` to ensure that only trusted addresses can call the function.

I give an example of how the modified code should look like below:
```solidity
function setIsTrusted(address user, bool trusted) public virtual requiresTrust {
    require(isTrusted[msg.sender], "UNTRUSTED");

    isTrusted[user] = trusted;
    emit UserTrustUpdated(user, trusted);
}
```
With this modification, the `setIsTrusted` function can only be called by trusted addresses, which ensures that the trust status cannot be changed by non-trusted addresses, fixing the vulnerability.
