# Some ERC20 tokens deduct a fee on transfer

## Summary
Protocol does not support fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens

The protocol currently uses any tokens:

> 	ERC20: any (USDC, DAI, USDT, ETH, stETH, etc)
>     REBASING TOKENS: any

Some ERC20 token implementations have a fee that is charged on each token transfer. This means that the transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

## Vulnerability Detail
See Summary

## Impact
The transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Improve support for fee on transfer type of ERC20. When pulling funds from the user using `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` the usual approach is to compare balances pre/post transfer, like so:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 transferred = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```
