# Missing check for approval, resulting in the loss of funds for the protocol

## Summary
A bad actor can let the protocol approve his address to spend the protocol's money,once there are funds in this protocol, the bad actor can immediately call `transferFrom()` to transfer the funds away.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol supports swapping sell token to target token. Inside the `_fillQuote()` function, the protocol first approve `quote.spender` to spend its money ` ERC20(address(quote.sellToken)).safeApprove(quote.spender, type(uint256).max);`, then swap token A to token B on 0x exchange. This `quote.spender` is derived from the parameter. Here is the problem, a bad actor can specify his own address, and the protocol will approve a bad acor to spend its money. Once there are funds in this protocol, the bad actor can immediately call `transferFrom()` to transfer the funds away.
```solidity
    function _fillQuote(SwapQuote calldata quote) internal returns (uint256 boughtAmount) {
        if (quote.sellToken == quote.buyToken) return 0; // No swap if the tokens are the same.
        if (quote.swapTarget != exchangeProxy) revert Errors.InvalidExchangeProxy();

        // Give `spender` an infinite allowance to spend this contract's `sellToken`.
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH)
            ERC20(address(quote.sellToken)).safeApprove(quote.spender, type(uint256).max);

```

## Impact
The protocol will lose funds.
