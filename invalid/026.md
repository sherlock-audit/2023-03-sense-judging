# The sponsorSeries() transaction may fail

## Summary
If external AMM  does not allow 0 quantity trading, the `sponsorSeries()`  transaction may fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows anyone to sponsor a new Series in any adapter previously onboarded onto the Divider. Inside the `sponsorSeries()` function, the protocol first transfer stake token from msg.sender to its contract if the `quote.sellToken` is not ETH.
 Then,call the swap function at 0x exchange protocol and swap the `quote.sellToken` to `quote.buyToken`. The exchange operations may be performed on uniswap v2, or v3 or other protocols. Actually there is no `quote.sellToken` in the Periphery contract, as the protocol only transfer stake token into the contract. Hence, the protocol will swap with 0 amount. If external AMM  does not allow 0 quantity trading, then the transaction will fail.Even if the swap transaction works, it will fail on the line ` if (boughtAmount == 0 || sellAmount == 0) revert Errors.ZeroSwapAmt();`
```solidity
    function sponsorSeries(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        bool withPool,
        PermitData calldata permit,
        SwapQuote calldata quote
    ) external payable returns (address pt, address yt) {
        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = Adapter(adapter).getStakeAndTarget();
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);
`
 ```
## Impact
The `sponsorSeries()` transaction may fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inside the `_fillQuote()` function,add code:
```solidity
       if (sellAmount== 0) revert Errors.ZeroSwapAmt();
       (bool success, bytes memory res) = quote.swapTarget.call{ value: msg.value }(quote.swapCallData);
        // if (!success) revert(_getRevertMsg(res));
        if (!success) revert Errors.ZeroExSwapFailed(res);
```
