# Lack of slippage control

## Summary
Protocol has slippage protection on many functions, but the issue() function has none.
## Vulnerability Detail
issue() function uses _toTarget() function to swap the quote token to the target token, but it doesn't have any slippage protection. Any other swap functions have slippage protection in the protocol. The pt and yt amounts can be less than expected, and users can lose funds.
## Impact
Unexpected swaps can occur, and users can suffer a huge loss due to no slippage protection.

## Recommendation
Use slippage protection as other swap functions use.
