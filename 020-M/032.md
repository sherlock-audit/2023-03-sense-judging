# Periphery#_swapPTsForTarget won't work correctly if PT is mature but redeem is restricted

## Summary

Periphery#_swapPTsForTarget doesn't properly account for mature PTs that have their redemption restricted

## Vulnerability Detail

[Periphery.sol#L531-L551](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-sense/blob/main/sense-v1/pkg/core/src/Periphery.sol#L531-L551)

    function _swapPTsForTarget(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        uint256 ptBal,
        PermitData calldata permit
    ) internal returns (uint256 tBal) {
        _transferFrom(permit, divider.pt(adapter, maturity), ptBal);

        if (divider.mscale(adapter, maturity) > 0) {
            tBal = divider.redeem(adapter, maturity, ptBal); <- @audit-issue always tries to redeem even if restricted
        } else {
            tBal = _balancerSwap(
                divider.pt(adapter, maturity),
                Adapter(adapter).target(),
                ptBal,
                BalancerPool(spaceFactory.pools(adapter, maturity)).getPoolId(),
                0,
                payable(address(this))
            );
        }
    }

Adapters can have their redeem restricted meaning the even when they are mature they can't be redeemed. In the scenario that it is restricted Periphery#_swapPTsForTarget simply won't work.

## Impact

Redemption will fail when redeem is restricted because it tries to redeem instead of swapping

## Recommendation

Use the same structure as _removeLiquidity:

        if (divider.mscale(adapter, maturity) > 0) {
            if (uint256(Adapter(adapter).level()).redeemRestricted()) {
                ptBal = _ptBal;
            } else {
                // 2. Redeem PTs for Target
                tBal += divider.redeem(adapter, maturity, _ptBal);
            }
