# If adapter collectDisabled malicious user can manipulate collect amount

## Summary
when collect of adapter is disabled ( level.collectDisabled is true ) the user can manipulate collect amount . 
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider that a user issues 1 YT token at time t1 then after a while and before maturity issues another 1000 YT tokens at time t2 but this time with different account , then she/he can transfer YT tokens issued in time t2 to first account , as collect function will return zero and no collect happens and state of receiver will not be updated the user benefits from lscale amount of the first account that has been set at time t1 , now first account has 1001 balance and when maturity arrives user collect amount will be calculated in a way that she/he has issued tokens in time t1 , actually how much difference between t1 and t2 is longer , she/he receives more collect amount that she/he is not eligible for it  . 
## Impact
User collect amount over calculated
