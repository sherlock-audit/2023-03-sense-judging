# sponsorSeries() method fails when user want to swap for stake token using

## Summary
`sponsorSeries()` fails when user want to use `swapQuote` to swap for stake token to sponsor a series.

## Vulnerability Detail
stake is token that user need to deposit (technically is pulled) to be able to sponsor a series for a given target.  User has option to send `SwapQuote calldata quote` and swap any ERC20 token for stake token.  Below is the code that doing transferFrom() of stakeToken not sellToken()

```solidity
if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
 if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);
```
Expected behaviour of this function is to pull `sellToken` from msg.sender when `address(quote.sellToken) != stake`. For example- stake token is WETH. User want to swap DAI for WETH in `sponsorSeries()`. In this case, user would be sending SwapQuote.sellToken = DAI and swapQuote.buyToke = WETH and expect that fillQuote() would swap it for WETH. This method will fail because sellToken not transferred from msg.sender.
## Impact
sponsorSeries() fails when `address(quote.sellToken) != stake`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementation of functionality to transferFrom `sellToken` from msg.sender with actual amount that is require to get exact amountOut greater or equal to `stakeSize`
