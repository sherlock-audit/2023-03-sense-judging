# Refund of protocol fee is being to wrong user

## Summary
There is one function, _fillQuote(), which is handling swap from `0x`. Ideally If there is any remaining protocol fee (in ETH) then it will be returned to sender aka msg.sender. There are scenarios when fee can be sent to receiver of swap instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Periphery and RollerPeriphery both are using almost identical logic in `_fillQuote()` hence this vulnerability affect both contracts. It exist if qupte.buyToken is ETH and there is any remaining protocol fee.

Here are pieces of puzzle
1. After swap if buyToken == ETH then store contract ETH balance in `boughtAmount`
```solidity
// RollerPeriphery.sol
251:   boughtAmount = address(quote.buyToken) == ETH ? address(this).balance : quote.buyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
```
2. Next it store refundAmt
```solidity
// RollerPeriphery.sol
257:        // Refund any unspent protocol fees (paid in ether) to the sender.
258:        uint256 refundAmt = address(this).balance;
```
3. Calculate actual refundAmt and transfer to sender
```solidity
259:        if (address(quote.buyToken) == ETH) refundAmt = refundAmt - boughtAmount;
260:        payable(msg.sender).transfer(refundAmt);
```
4. This is clear that due to line 251, 258 and 259, refundAmt is 0. So sender is not getting refund.
5. Later on in logic flow buyToken will be transferred to receiver
```solidity
110:        address(quote.buyToken) == ETH
111:                ? payable(receiver).transfer(amtOut)
112:                : ERC20(address(quote.buyToken)).safeTransfer(receiver, amtOut); // transfer bought tokens to receiver
```


## Impact
Sender is not getting protocol fee refund.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider intercepting refund amount properly when buyToken is ETH or else just handle refund when buyToken is NOT ETH and write some explanation around it.
