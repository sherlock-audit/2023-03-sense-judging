# Periphery#addLiquidity won't work correcty for issue restricted adapters

## Summary

Some adapters are issuance restricted meaning that they can't be issued unless the adapter directly mints from divider. The current structure of Periphery#addLiquidity always requires calling divider#issue. This means that Periphery won't be able to add liquidity for these adapters.

## Vulnerability Detail

For issue restricted adapters the contract should swap everything for target and then add single sided liquidity using only the target.
