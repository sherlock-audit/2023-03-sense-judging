# Usage of transfer() can result in revert

## Summary
The function Periphery.sol._transfer() is used by the _swapSenseToken to transfer ETH to the receiver.

## Vulnerability Detail
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

Specifically, the function Periphery.sol._transfer() will inevitably fail when 

1.The receiver smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function
2.The receiver smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
3.The receiver smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

## Impact
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which can result in revert. https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call instead of transfer(). Example: (bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}(""); require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");
