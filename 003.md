# Use of deprecated safeApprove() is discouraged and missing approve to zero could cause certain token transfer to fail

## Summary
OpenZeppelin's safeapprove() has issues similar to the ones found in [IERC20.approve()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-), and its usage is discouraged.

Whenever possible, use [safeIncreaseAllowance()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20-safeIncreaseAllowance-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-) and [safeDecreaseAllowance()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20-safeDecreaseAllowance-contract-IERC20-address-uint256-) instead.

Additionally, some tokens, e.g USDT, do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For instance, Tether (USDT)'s approve() will revert if the current approval has not been set to zero, serving to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

In the protocol, the functions using safeapprove() must be first approved by zero on top of getting it replaced by safeDecreaseAllowance(). 

## Impact
Otherwise, this function is going to revert every time such kinds of tokens get used.

## Recommendation
Consider approving 0 first prior to using the recommended safeIncreaseAllowance() to set the value of allowances.
