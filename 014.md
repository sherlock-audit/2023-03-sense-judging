```
The `_redeemYT()` function in the "codebase" uses the `fdivUp()` function to calculate the target balance, which can result in rounding errors that can be exploited by an attacker to drain funds from the contract. Specifically, the issue occurs when calculating the number of tokens to transfer from the adapter to the user when the "PTs" are at a loss and "YTs" had their principal cut to help cover the shortfall.
In this case, the function calculates the remaining balance of YT tokens using the `_reweightLScale()` function, which returns a value that can be rounded down due to the division by integers, however, the `fdivUp()` function is used instead of `fdiv()` to round up the result, which can cause an error in favor of the attacker.

Here is how an attacker can exploit and steal funds from the contract:

1. An attacker deposits 1,000 tokens into the contract and receives 1,000 YT tokens.
2. The adapter's target balance is 10,000 tokens and the current total supply of YT tokens is 10,000.
3. The "PTs" suffer a loss, and the adapter's target balance is reduced to 5,000 tokens.
4. The current total supply of YT tokens is still 10,000, so the contract uses the `_reweightLScale()` function to calculate the remaining balance of YT tokens: `(1,000 + 0) / ((1,000 / 10,000) + (0 / 5,000)) = 5,000`.
5. The user redeems their 1,000 YT tokens for the remaining balance of PT tokens using the _redeemYT() function. The function calculates the number of tokens to transfer as follows: `1,000.fdivUp(10,000 / 5,000) = 500`.
However, the correct number of tokens to transfer should be 1,000, since the contract still holds 5,000 PT tokens.
6. The attacker repeats this process until they drain all the PT tokens from the contract.

                    2. Current Total Supply: 10,000 YT Tokens
                    Adapter's Target Balance: 10,000 tokens

                (PTs suffer loss)         Adapter's Target Balance reduced to 5,000 tokens
            |                                  |
            |                                  |
                              
                    3. Current Total Supply: 10,000 YT Tokens
                      Contract uses the `_reweightLScale()` function 
                      to calculate the remaining balance of YT tokens: 
                      (1,000 + 0) / ((1,000 / 10,000) + (0 / 5,000)) = 5,000
                              
            |                                  |
            |                                  |
        user redeems                    5,000 PT Tokens
        1,000 YT tokens                       
            |                                  |
            |                                  |
                              
               5. The function calculates the number of PT tokens to transfer as follows: 
               1,000.fdivUp(10,000 / 5,000) = 500
               However, the correct number of tokens to transfer should be 1,000, 
               since the contract still holds 5,000 PT tokens. 
                              
            |                                  |
            |                                  |
         attacker                          contract

         6. Attacker repeats this process until they drain all the PT tokens from the contract.

## Impact
The vulnerability could allow attackers to exploit rounding errors in the `_redeemYT()` function to steal funds from the contract.

## Recommendation
The `_redeemYT()` function should use the `fdiv()` function instead of `fdivUp()` to calculate the number of tokens to transfer.
