# User may lose ETH

## Summary
Anyone can call payable `sponsorSeries()` function to sponsor a new Series, if users call the with stake token and attached some ETH, users may lose ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows users to sponsor a new Series in any adapter previously onboarded onto the Divider.Users can use any tokens and ETH to call the `sponsorSeries()` function. As the code below, if the sell token is stake token, the protocol will transfer the token to the contract. However, if users call the `sponsorSeries()` function attached some ETH as it is payable, users may lose assets.

```solidity
    function sponsorSeries(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        bool withPool,
        PermitData calldata permit,
        SwapQuote calldata quote
    ) external payable returns (address pt, address yt) {
        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = Adapter(adapter).getStakeAndTarget();
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);
```
