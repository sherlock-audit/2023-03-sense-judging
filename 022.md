# The sponsorSeries function in the Periphery Contract does not include any exception handling.

## Summary
The Periphery contract contains a flaw in its `sponsorSeries` function that allows an attacker to exploit the flaw to revert the transaction and revert any state changes.
The vulnerability exists because the `sponsorSeries` function does not handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `initSeries` function in the divider contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is that the `sponsorSeries` function does not handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of `divider.initSeries`, which could be exploited by an attacker to revert the transaction and revert any state changes.

The vulnerable code is in the `sponsorSeries` function, which calls the `initSeries` function in the divider contract:
```solidity
 (pt, yt) = divider.initSeries(adapter, maturity, msg.sender);
```
If an exception occurs during the execution of the `initSeries` function, the transaction will be reverted, but the `sponsorSeries` function does not handle this eventuality.

## Impact
Transaction Revert and State Changes Revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`sponsorSeries()` should handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of `initSeries()`, One way to do this is to use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution of `initSeries()` and handle them appropriately.
