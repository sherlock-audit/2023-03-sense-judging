# Use of transfer

## Summary

When transferring ETH, the protocol uses the `transfer` function. The `transfer` function is recommended against for it's fixed gas assumption.

## Vulnerability Detail

In order to mitigate against re-entrancy the `transfer` function uses a default gas stipend of `2300`. Although this may help prevent a re-entrancy, if gas prices change in the future, all functions using `transfer` will revert - forcing users to lose all spent gas.
 
## Impact

`_fillQuote - RollerPeriphery.sol`, `_fillQuote - Periphery.sol`, `redeem`, and `_transfer` may revert in the future if gas prices change (which has happened in the [past](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929)). Some functions listed are also used multiple times elsewhere in the protocol - these other functions will also revert.

## Recommendation

Consider using a low-level `call` when transferring ETH - while considering possible re-entrancy ramifications.
