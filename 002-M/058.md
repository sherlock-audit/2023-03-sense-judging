# Use of payable.transfer() might result in fund getting stuck

## Summary
Use of payable.transfer() might result in fund getting stuck
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol uses Solidity’s `transfer()` when transferring funds to the recipients in some cases. This has some notable shortcomings when the recipient is a smart contract, which can render funds impossible to transfer. Specifically, the transfer will inevitably fail when the smart contract:

-does not implement a payable fallback function, or
-implements a payable fallback function which would incur more than 2300 gas units, or
-implements a payable fallback function incurring less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call’s gas usage above 2300.


## Impact
Funds will get stuck
## Code Snippet
[RollerPeriphery.sol#L104-L115](https://github.com/sense-finance/auto-roller/blob/60b8b4d56346f053becafb6a9f50f75cebafcafa/src/RollerPeriphery.sol#L104-L115)
```solidity
    function redeem(AutoRoller roller, uint256 shares, address receiver, uint256 minAmountOut, PermitData calldata permit, SwapQuote calldata quote) external returns (uint256 amtOut) {
        _transferFrom(permit, address(roller), shares);

        if ((amtOut = _fromTarget(address(roller.adapter()), roller.redeem(shares, address(this), address(this)), quote)) < minAmountOut) {
            revert MinAmountOutError();
        }
        address(quote.buyToken) == ETH
            ? payable(receiver).transfer(amtOut)
            : ERC20(address(quote.buyToken)).safeTransfer(receiver, amtOut); // transfer bought tokens to receiver

        _transferRemainingUnderlying(roller, receiver);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call with its returned boolean checked in combination with re-entrancy guard.
Alternatively, Address.sendValue() available in [OpenZeppelin Contract’s Address library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L64-L69) can be used to transfer the Ether without being limited to 2300 gas units.

And again, in either of the above measures adopted, the risks of re-entrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the “Check-effects-interactions” pattern and/or using [OpenZeppelin Contract’s ReentrancyGuard contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L43-L54).
