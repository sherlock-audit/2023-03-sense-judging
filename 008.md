# malicious user can manipulate YT collect of other users

## Summary
malicious user can transfer 0 amount of YT tokens to other addresses and the collect function will update and _reweightLScale of receiver like he has received tokens but actually no transfer happened . 
## Vulnerability Detail
collect function in divider is called by YT contract during transferring YT tokens to collect rewards of sender and update lscale value of receiver in divider but there is a problem that if sender set amount 0 as transfer amount then collect function will use yt token balance of sender as uBalTransfer parameter to call _collect function and _collect function will _reweightLScale of receiver like he has been received uBalTransfer but actually no transfer has happened and sender still owns his tokens and no balance has been added to receiver but receiver state has been calculated this leads that receiver collect will be affected in future . 
malicious user only needs to transfer zero amounts of YT token to different users to affect their collect in future , more balance sender has more the receiver will be affected . 
```solidity
 function collect(
        address usr,
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        uint256 uBalTransfer,
        address to
    ) external nonReentrant onlyYT(adapter, maturity) whenNotPaused returns (uint256 collected) {
        uint256 uBal = YT(msg.sender).balanceOf(usr);
        return _collect(usr, adapter, maturity, uBal, uBalTransfer > 0 ? uBalTransfer : uBal, to);
    }
```
```solidity
uint256 ytBal = YT(_series.yt).balanceOf(to);
// If receiver holds yields, we set lscale to a computed "synthetic" lscales value that,
// for the updated yield balance, still assigns the correct amount of yield.
lscales[adapter][maturity][to] = ytBal > 0
    ? _reweightLScale(adapter, maturity, ytBal, uBalTransfer, to, _series.maxscale)
    : _series.maxscale;
uint256 tBalTransfer = uBalTransfer.fdiv(_series.maxscale);
```
## Impact
affecting collect amount of other users without cost

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in _collect function and make sure that if uBalTransfer is zero , it doesn't _reweightLScale of receiver address .
