# Remaining quote.sellToken are not being returned to caller

## Summary
Periphery and RollerPeriphery are using `_fillQuote()` function at many places to swap tokens on `0x`.
`_fillQuote()` perform swap and keeps track of sold amount and bought amount but does not send any remaining token back to user.

## Vulnerability Detail
In RollerPeriphery `redeem()` function is calling `_fillQuote` via `_fromTarget()` to sell underlying for buyToken and any remaining sellToken, in this case underlying, are being returned to user in `redeem()` but this is not the case when `deposit()` is calling `_fillQuote` via `_toTarget()`.

In Periphery, `_fillQuote()` being called from _fromTarget(), _toTarget() and sponsorSeries() functions and remaining sellTokens are not being returned to user.

## Impact
Any remaining sellTokens will stay in contract after swap.

Consider handling remaining sellTokens in `_fillQuote()` function only
