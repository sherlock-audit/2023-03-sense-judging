# Excess YT or PT tokens are not sent back to user after `swapYTsForTarget` is called

## Summary
Excess YT or PT tokens are not sent back to user after `swapYTsForTarget` is called

## Vulnerability Detail
Method `_flashBorrowAndSwapFromYTs` method is called from `_swapYTsForTarget`. Purpose of `_swapYTsForTarget` is to swap YT token for `targetToken` and burn equal amount of PT and Y.  In the flow of `_swapYTsForTarget` , it take flash loan of target token from adapter . Then swap the target token to pt token in balancer pool.   Once it has got pt token, then it call  below code to combine yt, pt token and get target token in return. 

` divider.combine(adapter, maturity, ptBal < amountIn ? ptBal : amountIn);`

Note that _amountIn here is ytToken balance.  `divider.combine()` method burn equal amount of yt and pt token  that why below check is applied  to send minimum of two token balance.

`ptBal < amountIn ? ptBal : amountIn` 

It is possible that yt and pt token are not exactly same after target is swaped for pt token..  Whenever pt or yt token is in excess, it remains in contract 

## Impact
Excess yt or pt token are not sent to caller.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In this particular scenario, consider returning excess yt/pt token to user.
