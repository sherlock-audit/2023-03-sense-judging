# Unsafe ERC20.transfer()

## Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

## Code Snippet
[Periphery.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-sense/blob/main/sense-v1/pkg/core/src/Periphery.sol#L419-L420)

```solidity
419: ERC20(divider.pt(adapter, maturity)).transfer(receiver, uBal);
420: ERC20(divider.yt(adapter, maturity)).transfer(receiver, uBal);
744: if (ptBal > 0) ERC20(pt).transfer(receiver, ptBal)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
