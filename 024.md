# solmate's safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom does not check code size of the token address

## Summary
The `safetransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` don't check the existence of code at the token address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `safetransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` don't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries. Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds, because if `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` are called on a token address that doesn't have a contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds have been transferred successfully, and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality, funds were never transferred. So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds.
## Impact
miscalculation and loss of funds

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin's `safeERC20` or implement a code existence check
