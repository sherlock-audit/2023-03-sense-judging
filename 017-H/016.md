# _permit provided is valid for the _stake token it can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the intended transfer limits.

## Summary
The `sponsorSeries` function in the Periphery contract does not verify that the permit provided is valid for the `_stake` token, due to this, an attacker can bypass the intended transfer limits, resulting in the loss of funds for the users, the attacker can initiate the `sponsorSeries` function by providing a malicious permit that is not valid for the stake token and this would allow the attacker to bypass transfer limits, allowing them to transfer more tokens than they should have, leading to the loss of funds for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `sponsorSeries` function does not verify that the `_permit` provided is valid for the `_stake` token and can lead to an attack resulting in loss of funds.

This code in the Periphery contract can be highlighted:
https://github.com/sense-finance/sense-v1/blob/82abac25404d83b7aefaaeb46631f1d050dc4a4e/pkg/core/src/Periphery.sol#L116-L140
```solidity
    function sponsorSeries(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        bool withPool,
        PermitData calldata permit,
        SwapQuote calldata quote
    ) external payable returns (address pt, address yt) {
        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = Adapter(adapter).getStakeAndTarget();
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);


        // Approve divider to withdraw stake assets
        ERC20(stake).safeApprove(address(divider), stakeSize);


        (pt, yt) = divider.initSeries(adapter, maturity, msg.sender);


        // Space pool is always created for verified adapters whilst is optional for unverified ones.
        // Automatically queueing series is only for verified adapters
        if (verified[adapter]) {
            spaceFactory.create(adapter, maturity);
        } else {
            if (withPool) {
                spaceFactory.create(adapter, maturity);
            }
        }
```
The function expects input parameters adapter, maturity, `withPool`, permit, and quote, among these parameters, the `permit` parameter is not validated for the stake token, the permit is a data structure containing the permit message and signature, and its `_msg` field must be valid for the `_stake` token to prevent any potential exploit but the function does not validate this condition.

As the function is not validating that the `_permit` provided is valid for the `_stake` token, this can be exploited by an attacker to bypass the intended transfer limits, resulting in loss of funds for the users.

## Impact
Loss of funds for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A validation check needs to be added to ensure that the `_msg` field of the permit is valid for the `_stake` token.
I can give an example of how the check can be added:
```solidity
function sponsorSeries(
    address adapter,
    uint256 maturity,
    bool withPool,
    PermitData calldata permit,
    SwapQuote calldata quote
) external payable returns (address pt, address yt) {
    (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = Adapter(adapter).getStakeAndTarget();
+   require(permit.msg.token == stake, "Permit is not valid for the stake token");
    if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
    if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);

    // Approve divider to withdraw stake assets
    ERC20(stake).safeApprove(address(divider), stakeSize);

    (pt, yt) = divider.initSeries(adapter, maturity, msg.sender);

    // Space pool is always created for verified adapters whilst is optional for unverified ones.
    // Automatically queueing series is only for verified adapters
    if (verified[adapter]) {
+       address spacePool = spaceFactory.pools(adapter, maturity);
+       _createBalancerPool(spacePool, withPool, PoolLiquidity(ERC20(stake), stakeSize, 0));
+       IAsset(spacePool).queue(pt, yt);
    }
}
```
In the updated code, a require statement is added to check that the `_msg` field of the permit is valid for the `_st`
