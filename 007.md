# Integer Overflow vulnerability in BaseAdapter contract

## Summary
The BaseAdapter contract contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the AdapterParams struct. The uint256 type variables minm, maxm, and stakeSize do not have any overflow protection. An attacker can supply large values for these variables, causing an integer overflow, and leading to unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause integer overflow which could lead to unexpected behavior, enabling them to drain funds from the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sense-finance/sense-v1/blob/82abac25404d83b7aefaaeb46631f1d050dc4a4e/pkg/core/src/adapters/abstract/BaseAdapter.sol#L41-L51

The uint256 type variables minm, maxm, and stakeSize do not have any overflow protection. If an attacker supplies large values for these variables, it could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability and unexpected behavior.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mitigation: To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend adding overflow protection to the uint256 type variables minm, maxm, and stakeSize in the AdapterParams struct. One way to do this is by using the SafeMath library, which provides functions for arithmetic operations with overflow protection. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough security audit of the contract to ensure there are no other similar vulnerabilities.

We suggest the following implementation to mitigate this vulnerability:

    Import the SafeMath library:
```solidity
import { SafeMath } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";
```
Replace uint256 type variables minm, maxm, and stakeSize with SafeMath uint256 type:
```solidity
using SafeMath for uint256;

struct AdapterParams {
    /// @notice Oracle address
    address oracle;
    /// @notice Token to stake at issuance
    address stake;
    /// @notice Amount to stake at issuance
    uint256 stakeSize;
    /// @notice Min maturity (seconds after block.timstamp)
    uint256 minm;
    /// @notice Max maturity (seconds after block.timstamp)
    uint256 maxm;
    /// @notice WAD number representing the percentage of the total
    /// principal that's set aside for Yield Tokens (e.g. 0.1e18 means that 10% of the principal is reserved).
    /// @notice If `0`, it means no principal is set aside for Yield Tokens
    uint64 tilt;
    /// @notice The number this function returns will be used to determine its access by checking for binary
    /// digits using the following scheme: <onRedeem(y/n)><collect(y/n)><combine(y/n)><issue(y/n)>
    /// (e.g. 0101 enables `collect` and `issue`, but not `combine`)
    uint48 level;
    /// @notice 0 for monthly, 1 for weekly
    uint16 mode;
}
```
Update the contract constructor to use SafeMath:
```solidity
constructor(
        address _divider,
        address _target,
        address _underlying,
        uint128 _ifee,
        AdapterParams memory _adapterParams
    ) {
        divider = _divider;
        target = _target;
        underlying = _underlying;
        ifee = _ifee;
        adapterParams.stakeSize = _adapterParams.stakeSize.add(0);
        adapterParams.minm = _adapterParams.minm.add(0);
        adapterParams.maxm = _adapterParams.maxm.add(0);
        adapterParams.tilt = _adapterParams.tilt;
        adapterParams.level = _adapterParams.level;
        adapterParams.mode = _adapterParams.mode;

        name = string(abi.encodePacked(ERC20(_target).name(), " Adapter"));
        symbol = string(abi.encodePacked(ERC20(_target).symbol(), "-adapter"));

        ERC20(_target).safeApprove(divider, type(uint256).max);
        ERC20(_adapterParams.stake).safeApprove(divider, type(uint256).max);
    }
```
