# Missing approve to zero could cause certain token transfer to fail

## Summary
Some tokens, e.g USDT, do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For instance, Tether (USDT)'s approve() will revert if the current approval has not been set to zero, serving to protect against front-running changes of approvals.Whenever possible, use OpenZeppelin's  `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`  instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the protocol, all functions using `safeApprove()` must be first approved by zero on top getting it replaced by safeDecreaseAllowance(). These are `sponsorSeries()` , `_onboardAdapter()` ,`_balancerSwap()`, `_addLiquidityToSpace()` and `_fillQuote()`  in Periphery.sol.
```solidity
function sponsorSeries(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        bool withPool,
        PermitData calldata permit,
        SwapQuote calldata quote
    ) external payable returns (address pt, address yt) {
        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = Adapter(adapter).getStakeAndTarget();
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, stake, stakeSize);
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != stake) _fillQuote(quote);

        // Approve divider to withdraw stake assets
        ERC20(stake).safeApprove(address(divider), stakeSize);

        (pt, yt) = divider.initSeries(adapter, maturity, msg.sender);

        // Space pool is always created for verified adapters whilst is optional for unverified ones.
        // Automatically queueing series is only for verified adapters
        if (verified[adapter]) {
            spaceFactory.create(adapter, maturity);
        } else {
            if (withPool) {
                spaceFactory.create(adapter, maturity);
            }
        }

        // Refund any excess stake assets
        ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, ERC20(stake).balanceOf(address(this)));

        emit SeriesSponsored(adapter, maturity, msg.sender);
    }

```

## Impact
These functions are going to revert every time they encounter such kind of tokens that might have a remaining allowance (even in dust amount) associated.

## Recommendation
Consider approving 0 first prior to using the recommended OpenZeppelin's safeIncreaseAllowance() to set the value of allowances.
