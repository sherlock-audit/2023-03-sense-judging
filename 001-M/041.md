# `RollerPeriphery` contract might not work for some ERC20 tokens such as USDT, because it's not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval

## Summary

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact

The `RollerPeriphery` contract might not work for some ERC20 tokens such as USDT. This is because the trusted caller cannot change the allowance of USDT from non-zero to non-zero.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: RollerPeriphery.sol
225:     function approve(ERC20 token, address to) public payable requiresTrust {
226:         token.safeApprove(to, type(uint256).max);
227:     }
```

## Recommendation

Approve with a zero amount first before setting the actual amount.
