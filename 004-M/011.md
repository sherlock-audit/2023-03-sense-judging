# Users can not purchase PTs and YTs with ETH

## Summary
There is no payable modifier for the `issue()` function, users are not able to use ETH to purchase PTs and YTs.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `issue()` function is used to mint PTs & YTs of a specific Series.  The protocol will swap `quote.sellToken` to target token and mint PTs and YTs to users. However,there is no payable modifier for the `issue()` function, users are not able to use ETH to purchase PTs and YTs.
```solidity
    function issue(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        uint256 amt,
        address receiver,
        PermitData calldata permit,
        SwapQuote calldata quote
    ) external returns (uint256 uBal) {
        if (address(quote.sellToken) != ETH) _transferFrom(permit, address(quote.sellToken), amt);
        uBal = divider.issue(adapter, maturity, _toTarget(adapter, amt, quote));
        ERC20(divider.pt(adapter, maturity)).transfer(receiver, uBal); // Send PTs to the receiver
        ERC20(divider.yt(adapter, maturity)).transfer(receiver, uBal); // Send YT to the receiver
    }
```
## Impact
Users are not able to use ETH to purchase PTs and YTs.
