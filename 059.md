# CENTRALIZATION RISK

## Summary

Possible Centralization Risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

The "Bank" contract, which includes a "onlyController" modification on its methods, is the contract that the "MarketToken" contract descends from. This modifies a contract's deployment to limit access to specific functions to a single "controller" address.

## Impact

As a result, the 'controller' address has the power to create new tokens and burn existing ones for any account, thereby controlling the token supply and raising the possibility of centralization problems.


## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is advised to adopt a more decentralized approach for managing the token supply, such as a community-based governance model or a multi-signature system, in order to prevent centralization problems.

In its place, a more adaptable access control mechanism, such OpenZeppelin's 'AccessControl' contract, which enables more granular control over who can do particular operations, can be used in place of the 'onlyController' modifier.
