# Give an infinite allowance to the `spender` that provided by user to spend contract's `sellToken`

## Summary
Periphery.sol#L902._fillQuote function is giving infinite allowance to address that is provided by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
in the Periphery.sol#L902._fillQuote function, the Periphery contract is giving infinite allowance to address that is provided by the user, to spend the contract's `sellToken`.

Any user can make a call to the Periphery.sol#L116.sponsorSeries function to  Sponsor a new Series in any adapter previously onboarded onto the Divider. One of the inputs in this function is the SwapQuote calldata quote. SwapQuote struct including :

>     struct SwapQuote {
>         ERC20 sellToken;
>         ERC20 buyToken;
>         address spender;
>         address payable swapTarget;
>         bytes swapCallData;
>     }

So user can use any address as a spender address. then in the Periphery.sol#L902._fillQuote function, we make a call to the Periphery.sol#L902._fillQuote function. in this function, at line Periphery.sol#L907, the Periphery contract gives `spender` an infinite allowance to spend this contract's `sellToken`.

So anytime, when the Periphery contract has a balance of more than zero for `sellToken`, the `spender` address can use transferFrom to withdraw the balance of `sellToken`.

## Impact
When you give an infinite allowance to the `spender` address for `sellToken`, `spender` can use front-run, and anytime the Periphery contract has a balance of more than zero for `sellToken`,  `spender` can withdraw it.

## Recommendation
Don't give infinite allowance to the `spender`, just use the amount that is needed.
